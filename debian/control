Description: create/join network namespaces at login
 libpam-net implements two pam modules:
 .
 pam_newnet.so: users belonging to the newnet group get a new network namespace
 at login.
 .
 pam_usernet.so users belonging to the usernet group get their own network name
 at login. If a network namespace having the same name as the username exists,
 pam runs the user's shell in that namespace. If such a namespace does not
 exist, it is created during the login process.
