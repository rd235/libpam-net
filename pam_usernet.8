.SH "NAME"
pam_usernet \- join the user own network namespace at login
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBpam_usernet\&.so\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The pam_usernet PAM module allow each user in \fIusernet\fR group to have their own
network namespace.

If a network namespace having the same name as the
username exists, pam runs the user shell in that namespace. If such a
namespace does does not exist, it is created during the login process.

The system administrator can create a network
namespace for each user in \fIusernet\fR group. Each namespace must be named
after each username.
Users will get their own network namespace at
login.

When pam_usernet is used together with a specific \fBcado(1)\fR configuration
users can configure their own networking services. (see https://github.com/rd235/cado)
